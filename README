derbystatter: Python tools for working with WFTDA statbook spreadsheets

These tools can read Excel WFTDA statbook spreadsheets, in either xlsx or xls
format. In order to support xls format, the xlrd module must be installed on
your system (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrd). Support for xlsx format is
provided by the xlsx.py included with the derbystatter package (which provides
a limited xlsx file reader capable of extracting the data from the statbook).

statbook.py provides the basic module to read the file as an object (instance
of class StatBook). The StatBook object includes direct referencts to the IBRF,
Score, Penalty, LineUp, JamTimer, Actions, and Errors sheet (which are used
internally), and objects for the jamTimer (one per period) and the home and
away teams. The teams then hold objects that ref to the data contained in the
various sheets (with scorekeeper, penaltyTracker, lineupTracker, actions, and
error, each a tuple of two objects, one per period). If there isn't a lineup
tracker sheet, it will attempt to use the scorekeeper sheet and the penalty
sheets to attempt to estimate the lineup (taking the jammer from the
scorekeeper, and then searching through all the penalties to find any record
skaters in the desired jam).

NB: Teams contain an array of objects for each period (so the period index will
be 0..1 since it is an array subscript). Jam numbers are 1 based (when passed
as a parameter)
